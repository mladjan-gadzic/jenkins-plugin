  With this option it is possible to connect directly to the TCP agent listener port.
  This skips the connection to an HTTP(S) port to retrieve some metadata.
  </p>

  <p>
  This is useful in scenarios where the controller does not expose an HTTP(S) port, for example
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner">Jenkinsfile Runner</a>,
  but more commonly if you simply wish to optimize the connection slightly.

  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> In <i>Direct Connection</i> mode agents will not be able to reconnect to a restarted controller if a <i>Random</i> 'TCP port for inbound agents' is configured!<br/>
    <b>Note:</b> <i>Direct Connection</i> does not work with the currently available <code>jenkins/inbound-agent:windowsservercore-1809</code> image.
