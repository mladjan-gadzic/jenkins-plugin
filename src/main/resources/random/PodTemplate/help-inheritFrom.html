<p>
    <b>Name</b> of the podTemplate to inherit from.
</p>
<p>
    A podTemplate may or may not inherit from an existing template.<br/>
    This means that the podTemplate will inherit node selector, service account, image pull secrets, containerTemplates and volumes from the template it inherits from.
</p>
<p>
    Service account and Node selector, when overridden, completely replace any value found on the “parent”.
</p>
<p>
    Container templates that are added to the podTemplate, that has a matching containerTemplate (a containerTemplate with the same name) in the <i>parent</i> template, will inherit the configuration of the parent containerTemplate.<br/>
    If no matching containerTemplate is found, the template is added as is.
</p>
    Volume inheritance works exactly as Container templates.
<p>
    Image Pull Secrets are combined (all secrets defined both on 'parent' and 'current' template are used).
</p>
<p>
    By default, pod template inherits outer pod template definitions.<br/>
    Inheritance can be stopped by using the empty string.
