<p>
    Specifies a shell which will run inside the container
    and process requests from Jenkins to run executables,
    set environment variables, and similar infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    This does <strong>not</strong> affect the shell used to run user code,
    such as <code>sh</code> steps.
    To run your scripts with a specific shell on Linux, use an interpreter line:
</p>
<pre><code>sh '''#!/bin/bash
for x in {0..9}; do echo x; done
'''</code></pre>
<p>
    or just use a subprocess and an externally versioned script:
</p>
<pre><code>sh 'bash ci.sh'</code></pre>
<p>
    On Windows, choose between the <code>bat</code> or <code>powershell</code> steps.
</p>
<p>
    For a pod running on Linux, defaults to <code>sh</code>, which should be in <code>$PATH</code>;
    for a pod running on Windows, defaults to <code>cmd</code>, which should be in <code>%Path%</code>.
    Should not generally be overridden.
